# Open Data Custodians

Welcome to the Open Data Custodians repo! We are a small team motivated to build open infrastructure for responsible data access and sharing pipelines. Read on to learn more about the project and how to contribute, if you are interested!

## About

Open Data Custodians is an open tool for connecting public Github repo data to a database/API. Inspired by [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), [BigCode](https://www.bigcode-project.org/), and [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/) communities and incubated within the [Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/), ODC aims to: 
- empower repo maintainers to do more with their data
- grant novel rights to data subjects and contributors
- create new pathways for responsible sharing of open data

## Contributing

If you have an idea or question, please feel free to open an issue in the ODC repo! If you'd be interested to chat more, please join The Turing Way Collaboration Cafe video call or [email Jen](jding@turing.ac.uk).
